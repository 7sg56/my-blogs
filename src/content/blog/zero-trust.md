# The Perimeter is Dead

In the modern digital landscape, the concept of a "trusted network" is obsolete. Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) assumes no implicit trust granted to assets or user accounts based solely on their physical or network location.

## Core Principles

1.  **Verify Explicitly:** Always authenticate and authorize based on all available data points.
2.  **Use Least Privileged Access:** Limit user access with Just-In-Time and Just-Enough-Access (JIT/JEA).
3.  **Assume Breach:** Minimize blast radius and segment access.

## Implementation Strategies

Moving to Zero Trust isn't a "rip and replace" operation. It's a journey.

> "Trust nothing, verify everything."

Start by identifying your most critical assets and mapping the transaction flows.
